Pregnancy after the age of 35 is considered higher risk due to natural declines in fertility and increased chances of complications. Common risks include chromosomal abnormalities, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm labor. Ovarian reserve decreases with age, making conception more challenging, and eggs may be of lower quality, reducing IVF success rates. However, IVF provides several benefits for women over 35. Advanced reproductive technologies allow monitoring and selecting healthy embryos, improving the likelihood of implantation. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) can detect chromosomal issues, reducing miscarriage risk. IVF also enables the use of donor eggs if necessary, further increasing success rates. Fertility clinics offer personalized protocols, adjusting medication doses and timing to optimize outcomes for older patients. Psychological counseling and support ensure women manage stress and maintain overall well-being during treatment. Despite potential risks, careful medical supervision and advanced IVF techniques can make pregnancy after 35 achievable and safe. Additionally, many women choose IVF to plan the timing of pregnancy according to personal and professional considerations. With modern fertility solutions, women over 35 can experience successful pregnancies while minimizing complications.
